# Captcha Recognition

A machine learning project for automated recognition and solving of various CAPTCHA formats using deep learning techniques.

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive solution for CAPTCHA recognition using computer vision and deep learning. The system is designed to process, analyze, and solve different types of CAPTCHAs, including text-based, image-based, and puzzle-based challenges.

## Features

- Multi-model architecture for different CAPTCHA types
- Pre-processing pipeline for image enhancement and normalization
- Transfer learning implementation with customizable models
- Training and evaluation scripts with detailed metrics
- Inference API for real-time CAPTCHA solving
- Support for popular CAPTCHA formats (reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, etc.)

Usage
Training a Model
bash# Train a basic OCR model on text CAPTCHAs
python training/train.py --config configs/text_captcha.yaml --epochs 50

# Train on image-based CAPTCHAs with transfer learning
python training/train.py --config configs/image_captcha.yaml --transfer --model resnet50
Evaluation
bash# Evaluate model performance
python evaluation/evaluate.py --model models/saved/text_captcha_v1.pt --test_data data/test

# Generate performance report
python evaluation/generate_report.py --model models/saved/text_captcha_v1.pt --output reports/
Inference
bash# Single image inference
python inference/predict.py --image path/to/captcha.jpg --model models/saved/text_captcha_v1.pt

# Start inference API server

Dataset
The models are trained on a combination of:

Synthetically generated CAPTCHAs
Manually labeled real-world samples
Augmented variants for improved robustness

We provide scripts to generate synthetic training data in the data/generation directory.
Ethical Considerations
