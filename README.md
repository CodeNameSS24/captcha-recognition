# Captcha Recognition

A machine learning project for automated recognition and solving of various CAPTCHA formats using deep learning techniques.

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive solution for CAPTCHA recognition using computer vision and deep learning. The system is designed to process, analyze, and solve different types of CAPTCHAs, including text-based, image-based, and puzzle-based challenges.

## Features

- Multi-model architecture for different CAPTCHA types
- Pre-processing pipeline for image enhancement and normalization
- Transfer learning implementation with customizable models
- Training and evaluation scripts with detailed metrics
- Inference API for real-time CAPTCHA solving
- Support for popular CAPTCHA formats (reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, etc.)

## Installation
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/CodeNameSS24/captcha-recognition.git`
- Set up virtual environment: `python -m venv venv` then `source venv/bin/activate` (On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`)
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Install optional GPU support: `pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt` (Only if you have compatible GPU)
